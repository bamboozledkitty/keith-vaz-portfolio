# Keith Vaz Portfolio

A personal bento-style portfolio showcasing design systems work, apps, visual design samples, and ideas.

## Features

- 🎨 **Bento-style Grid**: A modular layout inspired by [bento.me](https://bento.me), featuring drag-and-drop customization.
- 📱 **Responsive Design**: Fluid transitions between desktop and mobile layouts.
- 🔐 **Admin Interface**: A secure dashboard for real-time content management, built with GitHub OAuth and Cloudflare Workers.
- ⚡ **Performance**: Optimized with lazy-loading videos, compressed assets, and Gzip/Brotli support.
- 🚀 **Automation**: CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions for deployment and automated security scanning.

## Design Inspiration

This project is a tribute to the original [bento.me](https://bento.me). When they announced their shutdown, I wanted to preserve that unique "digital garden" feel and modular layout for my own work. This portfolio is an implementation of that aesthetic, built from scratch to be self-hosted and fully customizable.

## Tech Stack
